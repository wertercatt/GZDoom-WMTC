# WMTC (We Mapped This City)

## What?

_We Mapped This City_ is an outsider art project designed to celebrate the creativity and history of the Doom modding community.

The initial demo release is intended as a level submission for RAMP 2023.

It draws inspiration from Veddge's _MyHouse.pk3_, by seamlessly connecting multiple versions of the same area redesigned with different IWAD/TC assets.
