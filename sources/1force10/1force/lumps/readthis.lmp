Description             : COMMENCE PRIMARY IGNITION LIKE IT'S 1995! :P

  This is a light-weight reskin-orientated mod that aims to give the player
  a classic Star Wars Doom feel with more consistency and fewer bugs.

  Modern Star Wars mods focus on a total conversion, often using resources
  from various games and advanced scripting for ZDoom, EDGE, etc. This one
  takes the opposite approach; instead of Doom in the Star Wars Universe,
  it is created as if Star Wars originally took place in the Doom Universe.

  Essentially a deduplication and refurbishment of the many mid-1990s Star
  Wars mods from the "themes/starwars" subdirectory, this is designed to
  have the classic near-vanilla feel of those mods, mostly by reskinning,
  with as little scripting (DeHackEd, Decorate, SndInfo, etc.) as possible.

  * In come monsters and pickups matching their original behaviours!
  * Out go overused AlienDOOM guns that don't match the pickup sprites!
  * Out go cheesy sounds like "Whoo-Hoo!" when killing a storm trooper!
  * Pickup strings and some actors are slightly altered for consistency!

  Most actors have are sprite changes only; some are slightly renamed to
  make them more futuristic/magic looking, or for consistency with similar
  items. In a few cases they will behave slightly differently but better in
  ZDoom, with the overall look and feel being the same (e.g. tech pillars).

  Some special effects are available that give a more pleasing experience;
  however, they go way beyond reskinning and minor behavioural changes; they
  are thus provided in a separate WAD file, 1ForceFX.wad, which should be
  loaded after 1Force.wad; see the notes at the end for details. The main
  WAD file includes the resources for them; 1ForceFX is just the scripts.

  I made this purely for myself, so these ideas are highly subjective; this
  is being shared here in case anyone is looking for something similar.

                          again after over a decade :)

Known Bugs              : In vanilla Doom, sounds are inappropriately
                          shared (for example, probe droids will have pain
                          sounds of gamorreans, wookies, etc.) and some
                          animations are rather plain or look a bit odd.

                          This is not a bug as such, but a limitation of
                          the engine; to fix it would require stealing
                          sounds/frames from Doom II using DeHackEd, but
                          then it would not be extensible to Doom II.

NOTES
=====
=====

Future plans (in no particular order) include extending the special effects
WAD, an optional randomiser for multiple enemy variations, Doom 2 monsters
and items, plus possibly a texture and item pack for Vanilla Doom maps.

Replacing generic items such as powerups and tech decorations was fairly
straightforward. However, replacing HELL style decorations does not apply
to vanilla levels, so things like that are best left alone until some sort
of combined "textures and items" addon can be implemented.

Replacing Spectres, Revenants and Pain Elementals won't be simple reskin
jobs; properties of these monsters and the kind of maps they are designed
for would mean anything else wouldn't necessarily work in existing maps;
however, there are no simple equivalents in the Star Wars universe.

The Force Shadow replaces the Spectre with something a little less clumsy
than "A Gamorrean Pig Guard With A Cloaking Device" and, in fact, replaces
the Spectre with something similar and that could at least *possibly* have
come from the Star Wars universe. A melee-only version of the Hell Hound. If
you really want a backstory, let's just say that even The Emperor found that
making Force ghosts of his best hunting beasts was a *really* bad idea :)

Replacing Boss Brain ... ? !SACUL EGROEG ,EM LLIK TSUM UOY EMAG EHT NIW OT

There is a high-res generic vanilla replacement texture pack (recommended
for Xim's mod), but I don't know if there's a classic variant anywhere.

The Dark Magic weapons are there because Star Wars is based on energy
weapons and five is enough. Some sources mention Palpatine using Force
storms and electric attacks; there was already a "BFG as Force Curse" mod
early on. It was also sad that an Unholy Bible and Evil Scepter were planned
for Doom but never implemented beyond the pickup sprites released by John
Romero some years ago; so it was nice to bring them to life.

Please note that with most of these, I only used the sprites and in some
cases have heavily edited them. This is not out of disinterest, merely that
this is meant mainly to reskin actors rather than change their behaviour.
